# Linear Regression Problem - Bike Sharing

> Problem statement: To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

## Conclusions
- Fall season has the most bike share count, where as the Spring has the minimum count.
- The number of counts in 2019 is significantly (33.33%) more than in 2018.
- The number of counts in Jun, July, Aug and Sep are the most.
- The count is more when the weather is clear.
- The r2 score for the train and test datasets were: 0.7395, 0.7752
- We see, the important features in the final model were:
    - year, windspeed, spring, summer, winter, Jan, Sep, Sun, LightSnow and Mist.
