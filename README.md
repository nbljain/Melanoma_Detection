> Problem statement: To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

-
   - As, we have seen the high imbalance in the data, so we have used multiple metrics.
   - The final model has

        - F-1 score: 0.94
        - Recall: 0.93
        - Precision: 0.94
